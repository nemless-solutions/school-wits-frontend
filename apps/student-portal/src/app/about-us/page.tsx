            It All Started With a Question...

              What if learning could spark curiosity, not stress?
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-justify">
              That simple question became the foundation of School Wits. We
              recognized how traditional education often left students feeling
              overwhelmed, disengaged, or uninspired. We set out to bridge the
              gap between rigid systems and the dynamic potential of digital
              learning.

              Our in-person classes offer a focused, tech-enabled environment -
              with limited seats to ensure personalized attention. Classrooms
              are equipped with modern tools like interactive flat panels,
              projectors, and integrated video lessons - making every learning
              experience dynamic, visual, and engaging. Students benefit from
              regular performance insights, helping them stay aware of their
              progress and continuously improve - while also allowing parents to
              stay informed and actively involved in their learning journey.

            School Wits isn&apos;t just a typical learning platform - it&apos;s
            a school of wits, where sharp minds grow sharper, and creativity
            leads the way. Here, learning isn&apos;t about cramming facts;
            it&apos;s about discovering ideas, asking the right questions, and
            building the confidence to explore beyond textbooks.
